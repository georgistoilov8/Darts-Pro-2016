              	An awesome darts scoreboard and statistics app for the web. It's basically a website
		that has a scoreboard for the popular pub game of darts. It currently supports the standard
		301, 501, etc. format, but will support other gamemodes(and possibly other games) as development
		of the site progresses. It also supports statistics tracking, where it calculates statistics such
		as wins, losses, 3-dart average, checkout percenteges etc. The goal is to generate a leaderboard
		for all users of the site. In the future we will also add progress tracking, where players will
		have access to progression graphs that shows them their stats overtime, which lets them see whether their
		game is improving or not. This will allow them to figure out what element of their game to focus on during
		training.<br>
		In the more distant future, scoreboard and statistics support may be added for other games and sports.

            	Currently our scoreboard supports the standard darts gamemode
 		of playing from N hundred and one down to zero ( i.e. 301, 501). However we are hard at work on
		implementing support for other darts variations such as Around the Clock, Tic Tac Toe and others.<br>
 		Another key feature is stat tracking. After researching other darts scoring apps, we have concluded that
		we track the most stats of any other app. Also there does not seem to be overtime stat tracking in any of
		them (research not 100% conclusive). We would also be one of the first to support a real-time leaderboard
		for all registered players

            	The features of the website will be free to all registered users. Registration is free of charge.
		A desktop version of the entire service will be available soon. That version will be available for
		purchase, price is yet to be determined. The desktop version will offer offline support. This means
		you will not require a DartsPro2016 profile in order to use the app, rather you will have local profiles
		with which you will track your stats. The desktop app will have a local leaderboard spanning all local profiles.
